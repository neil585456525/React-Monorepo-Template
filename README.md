# React Monorepo Template

This repository serves as a robust template to kickstart your development of multiple React applications under a single Rush.js monorepo. Structuring your projects in a monorepo can bring numerous benefits such as shared configurations, atomic changes, and consistent developer environments and workflows. This template is designed to showcase an integrated solution featuring:

- **Build Configurations:** Pre-configured build setups to ensure smooth development and production workflows.
- **Unit Testing with ViTest:** Run unit tests efficiently with ViTest to ensure your applications are bug-free.
- **Storybook for Component Libraries:** Develop and showcase your React components interactively with Storybook.
- **Integration Testing with Playwright:** Run end-to-end tests using Playwright to ensure your applications work as expected from a user's perspective.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions:** Automate your testing and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions to deliver high-quality applications faster.
